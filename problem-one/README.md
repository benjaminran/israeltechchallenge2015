# Israel Tech Challenge 2015: Problem One

### Statement
In a language of your choosing, write a function that gets a string named str, and a string named set.The function will return the index of the first appearance of any char from set in str.

F.e. - str = "IsraelTechChallenge2015!", set="t98765!", the function will return 22 (index of '5' in str).

Make sure that time complexity isn't larger than the length of both strings - O(m+n). Assume the string only has ASCII characters.

### Solution
The solution is implemented in `stringcheck.py`. TODO: implementation details

The file `teststringcheck.py` tests my implementation for correctness and does some simple benchmarking in order to check the the algorithm isn't clearly slower than O(m+n).
