# Israel Tech Challenge 2016
First programming challenge for Israel Tech Challenge 2016 application


## Problem One

#### Statement
In a language of your choosing, write a function that gets a string named str, and a string named set.The function will return the index of the first appearance of any char from set in str.

F.e. - str = "IsraelTechChallenge2015!", set="t98765!", the function will return 22 (index of '5' in str).

Make sure that time complexity isn't larger than the length of both strings - O(m+n). Assume the string only has ASCII characters.

#### Solution
See the [problem-one](https://github.com/benjaminran/israeltechchallenge2015/tree/master/problem-one) directory.
